# Behavioural-Segmentation
Behavioural Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis. This project involves grouping bank customers based on their spending behaviour. The RFM technique will
be used to create features as outlined below:

R - Recency: how recently a customer has made a purchase

F - Frequency: how frequently a customer makes purchases

M - Monetary: how much money a customer spends on average

Each customer is scored for each RFM criteria. The K-Means clustering algorithm is then used to group customers with similar RFM scores. Grouping customers 
based on spending behaviour allows the marketing team to make personnalized marketing strategies which can boost a bank's engagement and income.
